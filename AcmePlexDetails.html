                                    <ul>
                                        <li>User Experience: A dynamic interface for browsing current and upcoming movies, viewing showtimes, and selecting specific seats in a real-time theater map.</li>

                                        <li>Booking & Payment Integration: A secure checkout flow that handles ticket purchases, and generates digital tickets.</li>

                                        <li>Administrative Dashboard: A private interface for theater managers to add new movie listings, modify showtimes, and track ticket sales analytics.</li>

                                    <p><b>Technical Breakdown:</b></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Frontend Framework: Developed using Angular, leveraging its TypeScript-based architecture to ensure a scalable and type-safe codebase.</li>
                                        <li>Component Architecture: Created a modular design with reusable components for the movie gallery, seat selection grid, and user authentication forms.</li>
                                        <li>State Management & Routing: Utilized Angular Routing for seamless navigation between the movie listings and the booking flow, and managed complex application states (like seat reservation timers) using Services and RxJS.</li>
