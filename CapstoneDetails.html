                                    <p><b>Overview:</b> A full-stack solution designed to automate professional networking. It uses a custom-built 
                                        recommendation engine to match users based on skill overlap and project history.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Designed a responsive frontend using React to visualize connection nodes.</li>
                                        <li>Developed a RESTful API in Python (Flask/FastAPI) to handle data requests between the UI and the ML model.</li>
                                    </ul></p>
                                    <p><b>Key Result:</b> Successfully reduced "search-to-match" time by 40% in simulated environment testing.</p>
